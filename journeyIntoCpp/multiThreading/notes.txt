Two types of Concurrent programming:
Multiporcessing(MP):
	Each process has a single thread that communicates throuch interprocess communication channels
Multithreading(MT):
	A single process has multiple threads that commuicate through shared memory
	Pros of MT:
		fast to start, processes take longer b/c OS needs to devote more resources to starting it 
		low overhead, processes take more overhead b/c the OS needs to be more careful of one process "stepping" on another
		MT provides better performance than MP
	Cons of MT:
		difficult to implement, lots of issues to take care of
		cannot be run on a distributed system, MP programs can, so people aruge that MT programs shoudl communicate more like MP programs
