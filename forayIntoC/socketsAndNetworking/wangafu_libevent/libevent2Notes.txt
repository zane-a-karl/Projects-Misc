Libevent:

	- A library for fast portable nonblocking IO
	- Should run on basically every useful system you need it
	- Should run the fastest possible nonblocking IO supported by the sys
	- Designed to work well  with 10s of thousands of active sockets
	- The most natural way to write a program in libevent should be the most stable and portable way

*evutil:*
	- generic functionality to abstract out the differences betw. diff. platforms and networking applications

*event and event_base:*
      - The heart of libevent
      - An abstract API for various platform specific, event-based non-blocking IO backends
      - Can let you know when sockets are ready to read and write, do basic timeout functionality, and detect OS signals

*bufferevent
